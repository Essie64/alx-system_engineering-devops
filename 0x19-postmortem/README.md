Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary
Duration:
Start Time: 2024-03-15 17:00 EAT
End Time: 2024-03-15 20:30 EAT
Impact:
The login service was down for approximately 3.5 hours.
Users experienced inability to log in, leading to a 30% user login failure rate during the outage.

Timeline
17:00 EAT:
Issue detected via monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed login attempts.
17:05 EAT:
Engineering team notified through automated alerting system.
17:10 EAT:
Initial investigation focused on the authentication server and database.
17:30 EAT:
Misleading assumption: Initially suspected a database connection issue due to recent updates.
18:00 EAT:
Issue escalated to the DevOps and Database teams for further investigation.
19:00 EAT:
Additional teams involved in debugging; false lead followed regarding a recent code deployment.
20:00 EAT:
After reviewing logs and network traffic, the issue identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication server.
20:30 EAT:
Authentication server configuration corrected, and login service restored.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The outage was caused by an incorrect configuration change in the authentication server during routine maintenance.
Resolution:
The misconfiguration was identified and corrected by rolling back the recent changes.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance the deployment process to include rigorous configuration checks before updates.
Implement automated rollback procedures for configuration changes.
Conduct regular training sessions for the operations team on identifying and resolving misconfigurations.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Implement automated testing for configuration changes.
Update the incident response plan to include specific steps for misconfigurations.
Conduct a review of recent changes to identify potential hidden misconfigurations.

Lessons Learned
This incident highlighted the critical importance of rigorous testing and validation for all configuration changes, even seemingly minor ones. The assumption that recent code deployments were the cause of the issue led to a delay in identifying the root cause.

The misleading paths taken during the investigation underscore the need for systematic debugging and thorough log analysis. Additionally, ensuring prompt escalation to the appropriate teams can significantly reduce the time to resolution.

Moving forward, we will prioritize the implementation of automated testing for configurations, especially in high-impact services like authentication. Regular training sessions will be conducted to enhance the skills of the operations team in identifying and resolving misconfigurations.

This postmortem serves as a reminder that continuous improvement in monitoring, testing, and incident response processes is crucial for maintaining the reliability and availability of our web stack.
